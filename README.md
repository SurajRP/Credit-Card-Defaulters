# Credit-Card-Defaulters
Credit card companies loan money to customers in exchange for the promise of repayment. Some will default on the loans, being unable to repay them for some reason. To prevent this situation, banks have to find some methods to predict customers’ behaviors 💰  #machinelearning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which is widely used by banking. Here, I have built an #ml model that predicts whether a credit card customer defaults or not! 💸  I have used a #dataset of credit card clients from Taiwan which contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements 📋  This one of my early end to end machine learning projects with 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬, 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐨 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭!
